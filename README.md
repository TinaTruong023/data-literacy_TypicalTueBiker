# Typical Biker in Tübingen

This is our project repository for the Data Literacy course (Uni Tübingen).


Suggestion:

- We use this for the setup of the structure and basically everything that would make it the finished project
- then we make a new clean clean repo where we just upload all of this

Notes:

- migration should work, notebooks have all been run
- missing: weather notebook, rework is in progress
- comments/orders can be written in folder specific todo.txt files

## TODOs
- Readmes schreiben
- Repo umbenennen nach Paper Titel!
