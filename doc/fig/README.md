# Paper Figures Folder

NOTE: I added prefix 'n_' for personal use, will be removed in the final version

Here figures are made by code (scripts) and not manually included in the latex file.\
We have figure scripts `fig_[DescriptiveName].py` which produce their pdf version.

**Filenames match to their scripts which created them!**

Example:\
fig_conceptualsketch.py\
fig_toyproblem.py\
fig_imagenet.py\
*fig_conceptualsketch.pdf*\
*fig_toyproblem.pdf*\
*fig_imagenet.pdf*
