# Weather Data
The dedicated [Weather Data Loader](LoadWeatherData.py) should be used for loading the data.

The weather data obtained through [Meteoblue](https://content.meteoblue.com/de/ueber-uns/rechtliches/agb) can not be made publicly available and is therefore not included in this repository.

The data used in this project is from 2014-2023 and contains the following measurements:
 - Tübingen Temperature [2 m elevation corrected]
 - Tübingen Precipitation Total
 - Tübingen Snowfall Amount
 - Tübingen Wind Gust
 - Tübingen Wind Speed [10 m]
 - Tübingen Wind Direction [10 m]
 - Tübingen Cloud Cover Total
 - Tübingen Sunshine Duration
