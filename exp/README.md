# Experiments Folder

All the analysis done for this project is located in the jupyter notebooks contained in this folder.
They are chronologically ordered and partially build upon each other.

The analysis can be seperated into 3 main categories:
 - Exploratory analysis of Eco Counter data consisting of [Counter Analysis](eva_1_CounterAnalysis.ipynb), [Trend Analysis](eva_2_TrendAnalysis.ipynb), [Week Analysis](eva_3_WeekAnalysis.ipynb) and [Day Analysis](eva_4_DayAnalysis.ipynb).
 - Correlation analysis of weather data with the cyclists [Counter Weather Correlation](eva_5_WeatherCorrelation.ipynb). Due to restricted access to the weather data, it is not possible to run this notebook, see [Weather Data](../dat/wea/README.md).
 - Correlation analysis of fuel price data with the cyclists [Fuel Price Correlation](eva_6_FuelPriceCorrelation.ipynb).

Each notebooks walks through the process step by step and explains what was done. The results are shortly discussed after each step.
Working through this should provide the user with a good knowledge about how a cyclist in TÃ¼bingen behaves and what affects their behaviour.
